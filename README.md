##Overview
This project implements a simplified "war" card game using DrRacket. It is a two player game. One being the computer and the other the player. The game deals 7 random cards to each player. Then each player discards a card from the top of his deck in turn and whoever gets higher card in value scores 2 points. The game keeps track of the score and whoever gets highest score wins the game.

* The objects in the OpenGL world are represented with **recursive data structures.**
* **Symbolic language processing techniques** are used in the parser.

##External Technology and Libraries
We used games/cards library


##Favorite Lines of Code
####Liuchen Ye
Each team member should identify a favorite line of code, expression, or procedure written by them, and explain what it does. Why is it your favorite? What OPL philosophy does it embody?
Remember code looks something like this:
```scheme
(map (lambda (x) (foldr compose functions)) data)
```
####Anand Surisetti
The simple callback function controls the whole process of looping the operation....
```
(region-callback hit-button)
```
